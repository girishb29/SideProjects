# Healthcare Analytics Storytelling Example

This project will utilize raw administrative claims data from Pharmetrics$^{TM}$. This is a rich data set containing over 5,800 unique patients, and over 1.7 million insurance claims. The patients are all on antidiabetic and/or anticoagulant medications, two populations of patients that may be at particular risk of adverse health events.

The raw claims file is interesting as-is, but to make it 'meatier' I'll pull in some patient demographic features from the insurance enrollment dataframe, merged on the unique alphanumeric patient IDs. For added clarity, details and descriptions from the prescription code, diagnosis code, and procedure code files are incorporated. Lastly, I complete some basic organization and formatting to prepare for analysis and report writing.
