There are 2 notebooks in this folder.  The "Data Cleaning" notebook is relatively complete, but the "Data Classification" one hasn't really been started.  I hope to come back to that one eventually...  
  
In the data cleaning notebook, there are the following sections:  
  
 - Step 1: Load the required libraries  
 - Step 2: Load & view the data  
 - Step 3: Prepare the data  
 - Step 4: Validate that the restructured data is correct  
 - Step 5: Write out the restructured datasets for future ingestion  
  

The data classification notebook is barely started but contains:  
  
 - Project overview  
 - Load libraries and plot formatting  
 - Load, view & prepare the provided data  
 - Preview the prepared dataframes  
 - Check data types
