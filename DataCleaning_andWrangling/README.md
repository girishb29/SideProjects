## Project Details  
  
This data is messy! First check the following expectations:  
  
 - We expect yield data to have one yield per org, year, field  
 - We expect there to be one measure of area (acreage) per field  
 - If there are problems, whatâ€™s the extent?  
 - How would you summarize this for our Customer Success or Product teams?  
 - Examine crop yield/harvest data quality  
  
Acknowledging that you may not have in-depth subject knowledge in agriculture, looking at the data provided how would you define data quality in this case?
